# Endurance - quick Pygame project
This is a simple game where you are a green square and must avoid red squares that constantly spawn around the map. You have no weapon besides the occasional speed boost, so see how long you can last!

Endurance is an incredily basic (and ugly-looking) Pygame project I made during school because I needed something to do during study hall. However, despite its janky and sometimes unfair gameplay, the people who tried it enjoyed it. So, I'm putting the code up here for anyone who wants to take a peek. If you want to use it (for some reason), feel free. I just wanted a place to put the project. You never know, it could come in handy some day.
